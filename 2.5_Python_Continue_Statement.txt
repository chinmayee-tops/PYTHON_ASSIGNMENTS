>>>What is the purpose continue statement in python?

Python Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block after the continue 
statement and forces the control to start the next iteration.

For example,
The following loop iterates from 1 to 10. By placing continue statement with the 
condition equal to number 6 then it will skip that iteration and continue with the 
next one. so that it will give output : 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 6:
        continue
    else:
        print(i, end=" ")
